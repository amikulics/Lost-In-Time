# Lost-In-Time

Lost in Time was a semester long group project for my game design class. In the game you played as a scientist that believed he could build a time machine but instead of it sending him to the future he gets sent to an alternate reality where his only way to escape is collect all the pieces of his machine and rebuild it.
My main roles were level design, level loading, objective UI, enemy effects, general bug fixing, and piece collection which was the main way for player to progress through the game.
